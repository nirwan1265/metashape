# Metashape Workflow

This space is intended to explain the proper workflow for Metaspace for image processing. The workflow will try to explain the steps required to run a basic Metashape workflow, i.e., build dense clouds, digital elevation model and orthomosaic patterns. It will use a python script to run as a batch job or as a parallel job.
